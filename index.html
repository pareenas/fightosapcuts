<h2>The Cuts Explained</h2>
  
  <ol type="A"> 
    <li><strong>The Government is reducing the family income threshold</strong> that is needed to make a student eligible 
      for the Ontario Student Grant. This means that the amount a family makes has been lowered 
      making it harder for students to be eligible for these student grants.</li>
    <li><strong>The Government has decided to eliminate the grace that allows students to find a job and a steady income</strong>
    within the six months after they graduate without interest being collected on their student loans. 
    This means that as soon as you graduate, the interest on your student loans begins to collect, 
    regardless of whether or not you have a job lined up for you outside of school. 
    This gives students less time to save up money and pay off their loans after they graduate.</li>
